<h1>How to Find the Perfect Breed</h1>

<H1>STEP ONE</H1>
<p>First you need to think about what kind of lifestyle you are living. Are you...</p>
<ul>
	<li>Active</li>
	<li>Couch Potato</li>
	<li>Outdoorsy</li>
</ul>
<body>
<h1>Step Two</h1>
<p>Second you need to look into the personalities of different dog breeds and truly think about which on would be the best match for you. There are many dogs that are less active than others or dogs that are more independant than others. It truly depends on what you want in a companion. This step is also extremely important because you do not want to get a dog not realizing that it does not like exercise when you got it so that you would have a running partner. </p>

<h1>Step Three</h1>
<p>After looking into your personality and different dog personalities you need to figure out if you would rather rescue or go to a breeder!Rescuing dogs means that the dog has been dropped off at a shelter or was found and now needs a home. These dogs most of the time if they are not rescued they will be put down. Breeders are people that mate dogs for a living and sell the puppies. These dogs are normally pure bred and therefore more prestigous. There is no wrong choice when deciding between adopting or shopping for a dog, but make sure that you know exactly what you are wanting out of your dog when making this decision.</p>
